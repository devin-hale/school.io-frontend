## Description

### Version 1.0.0

This is a project intended to act as a simple website for teachers to create, update,
and store important documentation. The idea came from listening to my wife, who is
a 3rd grade teacher. According to her, the biggest annoyance is a teacher is keeping 
track of documentation. This can be as simple as writing down
"I spoke with little Billy's parents at X time on Y date. We spoke about this...".
This documentation comes in handy when little Billy's mom calls the principal to
complain. Keeping that documentation is a way for the classroom teacher to CYA,
because without it, nobody else will.

It can also be as extensive as tracking specific student information over time,
as required by a state's board of education. The best case scenario is that this
documentation is never requested, and never needs to be used. The worst case
scenario is that the information is requested, but doesn't exist.

What makes all of this worse, is that the teacher must create all of this
documentation on top of their already stressful job of teaching. It takes up
valuable time from the teacher, and often cuts into their own personal time that
could be spent with family.

Essentially, I want this application to cut that down to an absolute minimum.
